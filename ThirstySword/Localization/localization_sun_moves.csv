blurb_sun_baking,"When you do, tell everyone what the aura looks like, and __roll+Daring__ to imbue it with power:
**10+:** Choose 1
**7–9:** Choose 1, and you can’t make that bread again this session

**•** Medical Bread: Tastes bitter; name a specific Condition to clear when eaten
**•** Solar Crust: Stays piping hot for a day or until the crust is broken, and provides the ambient warmth of a small campfire
**•** Heavy Crumb: Tastes familiar and comforting; become deeply sleepy after eating
**•** Klo Style: Tastes of the sea; temporarily gain gills for a few hours after eating
**•** Fortified: Dry in texture; when eaten, take +1 forward to roll with a stat chosen when baked
**•** Sugar Crust: Soft and fluffy; the scent diminishes feelings of aggression in those that smell it
**•** Golden Crust: The scent entrances those that smell it, causing them to float towards it; rumored to let you visit the afterlife while entranced
**•** Breadbane: Name a specific species that is repelled by the scent; it tastes really nice for everyone but those named
**•** Illuminated Crust: Tastes too sweet; glows and causes those who eat it to glow for a few hours
**•** Hard Crust: Tastes like a rock; can be used as a makeshift club in a pinch Imbued powers fade from the bread after one day.",
