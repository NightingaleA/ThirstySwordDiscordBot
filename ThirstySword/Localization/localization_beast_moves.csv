blurb_beast_feral,"**•** Your Feral score starts at 1. 
**•** If it hits 4, you can’t hold back the beast any longer and you Transform.
**•** If your Feral drops to 0, you lose access to all your Beast playbook moves until it increases again. On the plus side, you’re fitting in. You blend. You’ve assimilated.

**Increase Feral when:**
 **•** You express yourself in a shocking way through your appearance
 **•** You display intense emotion that society wants you to conceal

**Decrease Feral when:**
 **•** You feel that your bestial nature has hurt someone you care about
 **•** You go along with an uncomfortable interaction to fit in",
blurb_beast_transform,"When you do, tell everyone what the beast in you looks like, increase your Feral to 4 if it’s not there already, and __roll +Daring:__
**10+:** Choose 2
**7–9:** Choose 1

**•** You are in harmony with your beast and may clear a Condition
**•** You are magnificent and little escapes your notice; you gain leverage or an opportunity with a monster
**•** Pain is nothing to you; ignore the next time you would Stagger while transformed
**•** You can move in ways no ordinary person could

You revert to your usual form when your Feral drops below 4. While transformed, you may mark a Condition to avoid reducing your Feral, as often as you like.",
