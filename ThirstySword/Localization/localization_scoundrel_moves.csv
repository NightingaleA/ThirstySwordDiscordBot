blurb_scoundrel_moment,"Is there something you need to figure out about yourself, and you keep looking for it in other people instead? Are you afraid of the vulnerability that comes from investing in a relationship? Is your true love unattainable? Are you just that oblivious?

Choose something that you’ll be able to grow past to give your character an emotional story arc. You don’t need to figure it out immediately, and the Scoundrel themself may not know at all.",

If the target is an NPC:
**10+:**They’ll do it in exchange for a small concession or reassurance
**7–9:**They choose 1

**•** Create an opportunity for you or your allies
**•** They give you a String on them

If the target is a PC:
**10+:**They mark XP if they do it, and must take a Condition if they don’t
**7–9:**You choose 1

**•** They mark XP if they do it
**•**They take a Condition if they don’t

For either a PC or an NPC, if you aren’t already Smitten with them, you may choose to treat __a 7–9 result as a 10+__ by **choosing** to become **Smitten** with the target.",
